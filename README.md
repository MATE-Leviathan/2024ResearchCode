Hi! Welcome to Marlyn's code! Frontend code in React is in the Frontend branch and the Backend code in Python is in the Backend branch. 

# Frontend
Requirements to use the frontend is to have Node.js and npm on your computer. 
1. Run open the github code in VS Code as a folder.
2. Open Terminal
3. Run `npm i` to install necessary libraries
4. Run `npm run dev` to open the dashboard
5. Click one of the displayed ports (something like "https://localhost:5173")

# Backend
This is run on the Jetson and this code is already on there. The necessary libraries area also already there.
